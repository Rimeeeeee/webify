****Webify is a web3 mutual investment platform which allows curators from around the world to create several investment schemes and investors to invest in them. Funds can be drawn systematically by the end of time period. The concept minimizes third party intervention, increases transparency and allows a global platform to the curators. ****

## Getting Started

Create a project using this example:

```bash
npx thirdweb create --contract --template hardhat-javascript-starter
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `contracts/Contract.sol`.

To add functionality to your contracts, you can use the `@thirdweb-dev/contracts` package which provides base contracts and extensions to inherit. The package is already installed with this project. Head to our [Contracts Extensions Docs](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contractkit) to learn more.

## Building the project

After any changes to the contract, run:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

to compile your contracts. This will also detect the [Contracts Extensions Docs](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contractkit) detected on your contract.

## Deploying Contracts

When you're ready to deploy your contracts, just run one of the following command to deploy you're contracts:

```bash
npm run deploy
# or
yarn deploy
```

## Releasing Contracts

# or

```
